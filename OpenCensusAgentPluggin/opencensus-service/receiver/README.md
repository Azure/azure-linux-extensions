A variety of receivers are available to the OpenCensus Service (both Agent and Collector)

__Currently there are some inconsistencies between Agent and Collector configuration, those will be addressed by issue
[#135](https://github.com/census-instrumentation/opencensus-service/issues/135).__ 

## OpenCensus

This receiver receives spans from OpenCensus instrumented applications and translates them into the internal span types that are then sent to the collector/exporters.

Its address can be configured in the YAML configuration file under section "receivers", subsection "opencensus" and field "address". The syntax of the field "address" is `[address|host]:<port-number>`.

For example:

```yaml
receivers:
  opencensus:
    address: "127.0.0.1:55678"
```
### Writing with HTTP/JSON 

The OpenCensus receiver for the agent can receive trace export calls via
HTTP/JSON in addition to gRPC. The HTTP/JSON address is the same as gRPC as the
protocol is recognized and processed accordingly.

To write traces with HTTP/JSON, `POST` to `[address]/v1/trace`. The JSON message
format parallels the gRPC protobuf format, see this [OpenApi spec for it](https://github.com/census-instrumentation/opencensus-proto/blob/master/gen-openapi/opencensus/proto/agent/trace/v1/trace_service.swagger.json).

The HTTP/JSON endpoint can also optionally 
[CORS](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#cors-protocol), which is enabled by
specifying a list of allowed CORS origins in the `cors_allowed_origins` field:

```yaml
receivers:
  opencensus:
    address: "localhost:55678"
    cors_allowed_origins:
    - http://test.com
    # Origins can have wildcards with *, use * by itself to match any origin.
    - https://*.example.com  
```

### Collector Differences
(To be fixed via [#135](https://github.com/census-instrumentation/opencensus-service/issues/135))

By default this receiver is ALWAYS started on the OpenCensus Collector, it can be disabled via command-line by
using `--receive-oc-trace=false`. On the Collector only the port can be configured, example:

```yaml
receivers:
  opencensus:
    port: 55678

    # Settings below are only available on collector.

    # Changes the maximum msg size that can be received (default is 4MiB).
    # See https://godoc.org/google.golang.org/grpc#MaxRecvMsgSize for more information.
    max-recv-msg-size-mib: 32
    
    # Limits the maximum number of concurrent streams for each receiver transport (default is 100).
    # See https://godoc.org/google.golang.org/grpc#MaxConcurrentStreams for more information.
    max-concurrent-streams: 20

    # Controls the keepalive settings, typically used to help scenarios in which the senders have 
    # load-balancers or proxies between them and the collectors.
    keepalive:

      # This section controls the https://godoc.org/google.golang.org/grpc/keepalive#ServerParameters.
      # These are typically used to help load balancers by periodically terminating connections, or keeping
      # connections alive (preventing RSTs by proxies) when needed for bursts of data following periods of
      # inactivity.
      server-parameters:
        # max-connection-idle is the amount of time after which an idle connection would be closed,
        # the default is infinity.
        max-connection-idle: 90s
        # max-connection-age is the maximum amount of time a connection may exist before it is closed,
        # the default is infinity.
        max-connection-age: 180s
        # max-connection-age-grace is an additive period after max-connection-age for which the connection
        # will be forcibly closed. The default is infinity.
        max-connection-age-grace: 10s
        # time is a duration for which, if the server doesn't see any activity it pings the client to see
        # if the transport is still alive. The default is 2 hours.
        time: 30s
        # timeout is the wait time after a ping that the server waits for the response before closing the
        # connection. The default is 20 seconds.
        timeout: 5s 

      # This section controls the https://godoc.org/google.golang.org/grpc/keepalive#EnforcementPolicy.
      # It is used to set keepalive enforcement policy on the server-side. Server will close connection
      # with a client that violates this policy. 
      enforcement-policy:
        # min-time is the minimum amount of time a client should wait before sending a keepalive ping.
        # The default value is 5 minutes.
        min-time: 10s
        # permit-without-stream if true, server allows keepalive pings even when there are no active
        # streams(RPCs). The default is false.
        permit-without-stream: true
```

## Jaeger

This receiver receives spans from Jaeger collector HTTP and Thrift uploads and translates them into the internal span types that are then sent to the collector/exporters.

Its address can be configured in the YAML configuration file under section "receivers", subsection "jaeger" and fields "collector_http_port", "collector_thrift_port".

For example:

```yaml
receivers:
  jaeger:
    collector_thrift_port: 14267
    collector_http_port: 14268
```

### Collector Differences
(To be fixed via [#135](https://github.com/census-instrumentation/opencensus-service/issues/135))
 
On the Collector Jaeger reception at the default ports can be enabled via command-line `--receive-jaeger`, and the name of the fields is slightly different:

```yaml
receivers:
  jaeger:
    jaeger-thrift-tchannel-port: 14267
    jaeger-thrift-http-port: 14268
```

## Zipkin

This receiver receives spans from Zipkin (V1 and V2) HTTP uploads and translates them into the internal span types that are then sent to the collector/exporters.

Its address can be configured in the YAML configuration file under section "receivers", subsection "zipkin" and field "address".  The syntax of the field "address" is `[address|host]:<port-number>`.

For example:

```yaml
receivers:
  zipkin:
    address: "127.0.0.1:9411"
```

### Collector Differences
(To be fixed via [#135](https://github.com/census-instrumentation/opencensus-service/issues/135))
 
On the Collector Zipkin reception at the port 9411 can be enabled via command-line `--receive-zipkin`. On the Collector only the port can be configured, example:

```yaml
receivers:
  zipkin:
    port: 9411
```

## Prometheus

This receiver is a drop-in replacement for getting Prometheus to scrape your services. Just like you would write in a
YAML configuration file before starting Prometheus, such as with:
```shell
prometheus --config.file=prom.yaml
```

you can copy and paste that same configuration under section
```yaml
receivers:
  prometheus:
    config:
```

such as:
```yaml
receivers:
    prometheus:
      config:
        scrape_configs:
          - job_name: 'opencensus_service'
            scrape_interval: 5s
            static_configs:
              - targets: ['localhost:8889']

          - job_name: 'jdbc_apps'
            scrape_interval: 3s
            static_configs:
              - targets: ['localhost:9777']
```
