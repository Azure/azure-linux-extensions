Azure Disk Encryption for Linux helps protect and safeguard your data to meet your organizational security and compliance commitments. It uses LUKS and dm-crypt to provide volume encryption for the OS and data disks of Azure virtual machines (VMs). It is also integrated with Azure Key Vault to help you control and manage the disk encryption keys and secrets, and ensures that all data on the VM disks are encrypted at rest while in Azure storage.
