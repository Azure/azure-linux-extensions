     expansions of non-alphanumerics are expected to use all uppercase hex digits.

     a set of aggregates. The query is fixed to meet the needs of Linux Azure Diagnostics
     and includes customized partition and row keys.
 *   Create missing tables if full storage account credentials are suppplied.
 *   Enable mocking of MDS through storing events in a disk file (storeType="file").
