    - Newer monitoring agent bits with added features (not available on LAD yet)

2016-05-04: LAD-2.3.9
    - mdsd bits are now built as statically as possible, so that a single monolithic executable
      can be used on as many distros/versions.
    - OMI install result is checked and tried up to 3 times. If all fail, LAD install fails as well.
    - OMI is checked periodically for its health and LAD will restart it if OMI is not up.
